This project is a PHP-based web application for managing an online clothing store. It allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and search products using filters such as name, price, and category. Product data is stored in a MySQL database using PDO with secure prepared statements. The main page (products.php) displays all products in a table format, with additional pages for adding (add.php), viewing (view.php), editing (edit.php), and deleting (delete.php) products. Product images are uploaded in JPEG format and saved with the product ID as the filename. The application uses semantic HTML tags like <header> and <footer>, and includes a structured layout with consistent navigation and footer across all pages. The final project is submitted as a zipped folder containing all files and the SQL database export.
